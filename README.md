It was the last project I had submitted in week seven. I combined the use of Python and C++ to create a menu display that would list the item on a list as well as the number.  Depending on the user Input, it would determine which code was run, C++ or Python. I was pretty proud of how I was able to get Python and C++ to work well together. At first it was daunting and I wasn’t sure where to start, but I did ask for help and it did click for me after I reached out for help.  

I thought it worked really well but it could always be improved upon, I thought I could have added a bit more detail and gone into more depth.  That would have made the menu a bit more intricate and detailed.  I probably could have written everything in Python or everything in C++ to keep it simple, but in this case, I probably would have picked Python over C++ so there wouldn’t have been as much code.  

I admit at first, I was not sure how to get started so I did have to look up a few key terms and their meaning. I also reached out for help on this which did help me it also helped me understand the material much better. I needed refreshing on Python and there were a couple things on C++ that I needed help on but after looking them up I felt more confident.  

Pretty much everything that I have learned here I will be able to transfer to my other courses as well as use out in the field. All of the classes, meaning and programs will be very useful for me later.  It was a huge help to know that I have the ability to work with more than one language at a time. The best thing for me is to go at my own pace and not be afraid to reach out for help.  

I tried to keep the program as simple as possible and to use similar commands in both C++ and Python so it was readable and easier to understand.
